## System Architecture
### Frontend
-   **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
-   **Build Tool**: Vite
-   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui and Radix UI
-   **Routing**: Wouter
-   **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query)
-   **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation

### Backend
-   **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js

### Data Storage
-   **Database**: PostgreSQL (Neon serverless hosting)
-   **ORM**: Drizzle ORM
-   **Migrations**: Drizzle Kit
-   **Connection**: @neondatabase/serverless for connection pooling

### UI/UX Decisions
-   Platform detects environment (iOS/Android app vs. web browser) for tailored UX.
-   Mobile app features a dedicated mobile authentication flow, hidden footer, and bottom navigation.
-   Consistent black/gold color scheme (`#D4AF37`) for branding across the application.
-   Reusable AuthForm component with white/gold design for authentication pages.

### Key Features
-   **Authentication System**: Local username/password, session-based, admin roles, profile management, password reset via email with secure token-based flow.
-   **Campaign Management**: Creation, editing, media uploads, goal tracking, admin approval, search/filtering.
-   **Payment Processing**: Stripe integration for donations and membership subscriptions.
-   **Business Networking**: Business profiles, membership tiers, industry-based filtering.
-   **Content Creator Platform**: Creator profiles, social media integration (YouTube, TikTok, Instagram verification), sponsorship applications.
-   **Platform Posts**: Users can create posts with multiple media types (image, video, text, YouTube channel links). YouTube channel posts display as clickable cards that open the channel in a new tab, perfect for sharing exclusive or unlisted channels with the community.
-   **Administrative Dashboard**: Campaign/user management, donation tracking, sponsorship review.
-   **Notification System**: Real-time notifications for user interactions (follows, likes, comments, chat), with read/unread status and smart self-notification prevention.
-   **Mobile Optimization**: Capacitor platform detection, mobile-optimized authentication flow, safe area padding, and specific UI adjustments for mobile devices.

### Deployment Strategy
-   **Development**: Local environment with HMR, SQLite/PostgreSQL, Vite dev server.
-   **Production**: Optimized static assets, Express server, automatic database migrations, environment-specific configuration.
-   **Database Management**: Drizzle migrations, automated backups, connection pooling, query optimization.

## External Dependencies
-   **Payment Processing**: Stripe, Stripe Elements
-   **Social Media APIs**: YouTube Data API, Apify (TikTok/Instagram scraping), custom scrapers
-   **Email Services**: Resend (production & development), Ethereal (development fallback)
-   **UI and Styling**: Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Radix UI, Lucide React (icons)
-   **Development Tools**: TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, Vite

## Password Reset Feature
### Overview
Secure password reset functionality with email-based token verification. Users can request a password reset link from the login page, receive an email with a secure token, and set a new password which automatically logs them in.

### Security Implementation
-   **Token Generation**: 32-byte cryptographically secure random tokens using `crypto.randomBytes`
-   **Token Storage**: Tokens are hashed with SHA256 before database storage to prevent compromise if database is accessed
-   **Token Expiry**: Reset tokens expire after 1 hour
-   **One-Time Use**: Tokens are marked as used after successful password reset
-   **URL Safety**: Tokens are URL-encoded in email links to prevent truncation issues
-   **Email Verification**: Password reset only works for registered email addresses (with anti-enumeration protection)

### Database Schema
`passwordResetTokens` table:
-   `id`: Serial primary key
-   `userId`: Reference to users table
-   `email`: User's email address
-   `token`: SHA256-hashed reset token
-   `expiresAt`: Token expiration timestamp (1 hour from creation)
-   `used`: Boolean flag to prevent token reuse

### User Flow
1. User clicks "Forgot Password?" on login page
2. User enters email address in modal dialog
3. System generates secure token, hashes it, stores it in database
4. Email sent with reset link containing plaintext token
5. User clicks link, navigated to `/reset-password?token=xxx`
6. User enters new password (6+ characters) twice
7. System validates token (hashes incoming token, checks database)
8. Password updated, token marked as used, user automatically logged in
9. User redirected to feed page

### API Endpoints
-   `POST /api/auth/forgot-password`: Accepts email, generates token, sends reset email
-   `POST /api/auth/reset-password`: Validates token, updates password, creates session

### Frontend Components
-   **AuthForm**: Contains "Forgot Password?" button and modal dialog
-   **ResetPassword**: Dedicated page for password reset with dual password fields

### Known Limitations
-   Old sessions are not automatically invalidated when password is reset (MemoryStore limitation)
-   New login session is created after reset, but existing sessions remain valid until expiry

## Mobile Session Management (Capacitor WebView Fix)
### Overview
Capacitor's WebView doesn't reliably persist HTTP-only cookies, which broke session management for the mobile app. Implemented a custom session header solution that works across both web and mobile platforms.

### Implementation
**Backend Changes:**
- Modified `/api/login` and `/api/register` endpoints to return `sessionId` in response
- Added middleware to accept `X-Session-ID` custom header and restore sessions from session store
- Updated CORS to allow `X-Session-ID` header from mobile origins

**Frontend Changes:**
- Store `sessionId` in `localStorage` when login/register succeeds
- Send `X-Session-ID` header with all API requests (GET and POST)
- Clear `sessionId` from `localStorage` on logout

### Authentication Flow
1. **Login/Register**: Backend creates session, returns `sessionId` in response body
2. **Client Storage**: Frontend stores `sessionId` in `localStorage`
3. **Subsequent Requests**: All API calls include `X-Session-ID` header
4. **Session Restoration**: Backend middleware checks for header, loads session from store
5. **Logout**: Frontend clears `localStorage`, backend destroys session

### Mobile Auth Consistency
Both web and mobile authentication now use the same flow:
- Login/register redirect to "/" (home page) after 400ms delay
- MobileLandingPage automatically redirects mobile users to "/feed"
- This ensures proper session propagation before navigation

### Debugging
Server logs show session flow:
- `‚úÖ Login successful for: [username]` - Login succeeded
- `üìù Session ID: [id]` - Session created  
- `üì± Mobile app session ID detected: [id]` - Session ID received via header
- `‚úÖ Session restored from header for user: [username]` - Session successfully restored
- `‚ùå User not authenticated` - Session not found or invalid
